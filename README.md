# PrimeNumbers

This is a Git repository that contains the python script for 
Part 1 of Assignment 2 of _Introduction in Python Programming_ Part Time Course of Cardiff University.

A Python script, named prime.py, which prompts the user to enter a decimal number containing up to 3 digits 
and determines whether the number entered is a prime number.

The program starts by first displaying on the screen the message "Please enter a decimal number" and the user should
then input a string of up to 3 characters from the keyboard followed by the RETURN key.
  
If more than 3 characters are entered via the keyboard, the program outputs the message "More than 3 characters and exit".
If a non-numeric character is entered via the keyboard, the program outputs the message "Invalid input and exit".
If the input is valid, your program displays either the message "Number entered is a prime number" or the message
"Number entered is not a prime number".
